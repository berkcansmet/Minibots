Okay, so here is how we split the work:
-> Function name suggestion?

1) Motors + light sensor: We need to provide code to drive the motor (at different speeds depending on ultrasonic?) and light sensors to ..uh.. do something?
2) Ultrasonic: We need a function to set the threshold of the ultrasonic sensor and a function to check if that threshold is maintained
3) Sensors: I am not sure what is the point of the sensors, so I'd say we only need to implement a function to return the status of the sensors, to check if they are normal.
4) Claws: We need to implement the function which controls the claws, by passing two ints to determine how wide the claw should be and (maybe) how fast.
